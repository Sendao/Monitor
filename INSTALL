# 0. be root.

# 1. Fix the location in 'monitor.service' to point to the right runtime path.
# ( So, send-slack.sh must be in PATH or it won't run as a service. workaround is to cwd from within the code or pipe)

# 2. Run the 'install_services' to copy demo and monitor services to /etc/systemd/system.

# 3. Theorhetically, service monitor start ... but I haven't gotten that to actually work.

# 4. Instead, run 'screen -dm ./monitor ./monitor.cfg' or tmux new -s 'monitor' -d './monitor ./monitor.cfg' to start the service.

# 5. Wait for updates! play some psdoom http://psdoom.sourceforge.net/
