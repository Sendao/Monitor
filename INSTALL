Copy the file 'monitor.blank.service' to 'monitor.service'
Then run 'mkdebug' or 'mkbuild'. cd to the created directory and run 'make ; sudo make install'
You should now have a blank monitor running in the background. You can control the service using systemctl.
systemctl status monitor ; systemctl start monitor ; systemctl status monitor

Edit /etc/monitor.cfg to configure.
