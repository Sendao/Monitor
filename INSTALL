You'll need to configure the monitor before installing it. Until it is installed, the monitor can be run
on the commandline. This is not a good way to run the monitor; you should install it or it may have issues
forking new processes due to shell limitations.

# 1. Fix the location in 'monitor.service' to point to the right runtime path.
# ( So, send-slack.sh must be in PATH or it won't run as a service. workaround is to cwd from within the code or pipe)

# 2. Copy monitor.sh to /etc/init.d and monitor.service to /lib/systemd/system

# 3. Install the service with 'systemctl enable monitor'

# 4. Run the service with 'systemctl start monitor'

# 5. Wait for updates! play some psdoom http://psdoom.sourceforge.net/
